## Quick Start

### Basic GitHub Actions Workflow

1. **Create workflow file** — Save as `.github/workflows/ci.yml` in repository root
2. **Define triggers** — Use `on:` to specify when workflow runs (push, pull_request, schedule)
3. **Configure job** — Define jobs with name, runner type, and steps
4. **Add checkout** — Use `actions/checkout@v4` to access repository code
5. **Run commands** — Add steps with `run:` or use community actions

### Minimal Workflow

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "Running CI pipeline"
```

### Workflow Anatomy

```yaml
workflow
├── name: Display name
├── on: Trigger events (push, pull_request, schedule, workflow_dispatch)
├── env: Workflow-level environment variables
└── jobs:
    └── <job-name>:
        ├── runs-on: Runner type (ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest)
        ├── env: Job-level environment variables
        ├── strategy: Matrix, fail-fast, max-parallel settings
        └── steps:
            ├── uses: Pre-built action
            └── run: Shell command or script
```

### File Location

All workflows must be in `.github/workflows/` directory with `.yml` or `.yaml` extension. Use kebab-case for filenames: `build-and-test.yml`, `deploy-production.yml`.

### Quick Validation

Validate YAML syntax before pushing:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/data" pipelinecomponents/yamllint yamllint /data/.github/workflows/
```
