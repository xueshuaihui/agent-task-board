# Code Simplify

Make the **current diff** simpler and clearer without changing what it does.

## Instructions

1. **Scope to the current diff.** Inspect `git diff` (unstaged) and
   `git diff --cached` (staged) and only refactor code that changed.
2. **Simplify, behavior-preserving:**
   - remove duplication and dead/unreachable code
   - flatten deep nesting (early returns, guard clauses)
   - collapse redundant intermediate variables and needless abstraction
   - prefer standard-library and existing project helpers over new code —
     search the codebase for an existing utility before writing one

   Done only when every changed hunk has been considered for simplification.
3. **Keep it minimal (YAGNI).** The diff's current needs set the ceiling —
   ship the smallest change that simplifies.
4. **Preserve behavior and public interfaces.** Same inputs → same outputs,
   same side effects, same exported signatures unless explicitly asked.
5. **Verify** after simplifying: run the project's tests / typecheck / linter
   where available, and report the result.
6. **Report briefly** what you simplified and why.
