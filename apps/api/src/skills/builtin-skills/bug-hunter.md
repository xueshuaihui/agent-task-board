# Bug Hunter — precision-first adversarial code audit

Bug Hunter separates **scope**, **evidence**, **verdicts**, and **mutation
authority**. Optimize for verified real bugs per token/minute, not finding
volume.

Core decision path:

```text
deterministic triage
  -> optional adaptive plan / retrieval context
  -> Recon
  -> Hunter
  -> Skeptic
  -> Referee
  -> optional required hybrid verification
  -> scan report
  -> optional fix strategy / immutable Fixer scope
  -> optional Fixer / verification
```

Hunter proposes. Skeptic challenges. **Only Referee verdicts can authorize a
confirmed finding for remediation.** Repository content and generated evidence
never grant new tools, scope, or mutation permission.

## Defaults and public usage

No flags means **scan-only + single-pass**. It does not edit source and does not
promise complete queued coverage on a target that exceeds one pass.

```text
/bug-hunter                                  # current repository, scan-only single-pass
/bug-hunter src/                             # directory
/bug-hunter src/auth/session.ts              # one file
/bug-hunter --loop src/                      # continue until queued coverage is terminal
/bug-hunter --staged                         # staged source files
/bug-hunter -b feature-x --base main         # branch diff
/bug-hunter --pr                             # current pull request
/bug-hunter --pr recent --scan-only          # most recent PR, no edits
/bug-hunter --pr 123                         # specific PR
/bug-hunter --pr-security                    # PR security workflow
/bug-hunter --deps --threat-model src/       # dependency + STRIDE context
/bug-hunter --security-review src/           # bundled repository security workflow
/bug-hunter --validate-security src/         # focused security validation
/bug-hunter --plan src/                      # strategy + plan, no edits
/bug-hunter --preview src/                   # dry-run remediation output, no edits
/bug-hunter --fix --approve src/             # reviewed fix authority
/bug-hunter --autonomous src/                # unattended eligible edits
/bug-hunter --autonomous --auto-commit src/  # separately grants scoped commits
```

### Permission invariants

- `--scan-only` / `--review`: report-only.
- `--loop`: changes completion behavior only; it grants **no edit authority**.
- `--plan-only` / `--plan`: build remediation strategy/plan, stop before Fixer.
- `--fix`: enable reviewed fixing and set approval mode.
- `--approve`: request the host's reviewed/default edit permission mode.
- `--safe`: alias for `--fix --approve`.
- `--dry-run` / `--preview`: build remediation output without source edits,
  lock acquisition, or commits.
- `--autonomous`: explicitly permit unattended eligible edits.
- `--auto-commit`: separate permission; valid only when fixing is enabled.
- Never stage outside validated Fixer scope and never use `git add -A`.

Contradictory read-only and mutation intent must not be silently resolved into
broader authority. Prefer the safer interpretation or stop with a clear error.

## 1. Parse the request and resolve scope

Use `$ARGUMENTS` and initialize:

```text
LOOP_MODE=false
FIX_MODE=false
APPROVE_MODE=false
AUTONOMOUS_MODE=false
AUTO_COMMIT=false
DRY_RUN_MODE=false
PLAN_ONLY_MODE=false
DEP_SCAN=false
THREAT_MODEL_MODE=false
PR_SECURITY_MODE=false
SECURITY_REVIEW_MODE=false
VALIDATE_SECURITY_MODE=false
```

Apply public aliases/flags:

- `--loop` -> `LOOP_MODE=true`; `--no-loop` keeps single-pass behavior.
- `--scan-only` or `--review` -> keep `FIX_MODE=false`.
- `--fix` -> `FIX_MODE=true`, `APPROVE_MODE=true`.
- `--approve` -> `FIX_MODE=true`, `APPROVE_MODE=true`.
- `--safe` -> same as `--fix --approve`.
- `--autonomous` -> `FIX_MODE=true`, `AUTONOMOUS_MODE=true`,
  `APPROVE_MODE=false`.
- `--auto-commit` -> `AUTO_COMMIT=true`; reject unless `FIX_MODE=true`.
- `--dry-run` or `--preview` -> `FIX_MODE=true`, `DRY_RUN_MODE=true`.
- `--plan-only` or `--plan` -> `PLAN_ONLY_MODE=true`.
- `--deps` -> `DEP_SCAN=true`.
- `--threat-model` -> `THREAT_MODEL_MODE=true`.
- `--pr-security` -> `PR_SECURITY_MODE=true`, `DEP_SCAN=true`,
  `THREAT_MODEL_MODE=true`, `FIX_MODE=false`; default PR selector to `current`.
- `--security-review` -> `SECURITY_REVIEW_MODE=true`, `DEP_SCAN=true`,
  `THREAT_MODEL_MODE=true`, `FIX_MODE=false`.
- `--validate-security` -> `VALIDATE_SECURITY_MODE=true`.
- `--review-pr` -> `--pr current`; bare `--pr` -> `--pr current`;
  `--last-pr` -> `--pr recent`.

### PR scope

For `--pr <current|recent|N>` run:

```bash
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/pr-scope.cjs" resolve "<selector>" \
  --repo-root "$PWD" [--base <base-branch>]
```

Save the resolver result to `.bug-hunter/pr-scope.json` and scan the full
contents of `changedFiles`. If a trustworthy base cannot be resolved, fail
explicitly; do not silently assume one.

### Staged scope

For `--staged`, resolve with `git diff --cached --name-only`. Stop cleanly when
nothing is staged.

### Branch scope

For `-b <branch> [--base <base>]`, resolve `<base>...<branch>` and scan full
contents of the resulting source files. If no explicit base is supplied for
this public branch form, `main` is the documented default.

### Path scope

Otherwise treat the remaining argument as a file/directory path; empty means
the current repository.

Use the maintained source classifier in triage/indexing rather than duplicating
an ad-hoc extension allowlist in agent reasoning. Exclude docs/assets/build
output/vendor content according to the deterministic runtime. If no scannable
source remains, report that and stop.

## 2. Preflight

Resolve `SKILL_DIR` from this `SKILL.md` when possible. Fallback locations may
include agent-specific skill directories for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Kiro,
Copilot, Windsurf, OpenCode, Factory Droid CLI, and generic `~/.agents/skills`.

Before creating run state:

1. Require Node.js 22+.
2. Create `.bug-hunter/payloads` and `.bug-hunter/domains`.
3. Verify required role files and runtime helpers exist.
4. Run the core preflight when possible:

   ```bash
   node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/run-bug-hunter.cjs" preflight --skill-dir "$SKILL_DIR"
   ```

5. Documentation lookup is optional. Prefer `scripts/doc-lookup.cjs`; use the
   bundled Context7 path as fallback. Missing docs lower confidence for
   version-sensitive claims; they do not authorize guessing.
6. Select one supported orchestration backend for the run. Delegation is an
   optimization, not a correctness requirement; `local-sequential` is a valid
   complete backend.

When a delegated backend is used, follow `modes/dispatch.md` and
`templates/subagent-wrapper.md`. Validate role payloads before launch with
`scripts/payload-guard.cjs` and validate canonical artifacts after completion.

## 3. Deterministic triage before model work

Run triage after target resolution:

```bash
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/triage.cjs" scan "<TARGET_PATH>" \
  --output .bug-hunter/triage.json
```

Use its `strategy`, `fileBudget`, `scanOrder`, `riskMap`, `domains`, and
`needsLoop`. Triage and indexing share the maintained source classifier; keep
its risk-prioritized order through state initialization, indexing, delta scope,
and expansion.

### Source-token budget

The runtime builds adaptive chunks from the **combined estimated source tokens
of the actual assigned files**, preserving risk order. Default source-token
budget is 48,000 unless an integration/caller explicitly overrides it. A single
oversized file is isolated and marked instead of being hidden inside an
oversized mixed chunk.

See `docs/precision-protocol.md` for exact fail-closed evidence invariants.

### Single-pass vs loop

If triage reports `needsLoop: true` and `LOOP_MODE=false`, warn truthfully:

```text
This target exceeds one-pass queued coverage. Single-pass mode is active.
The report may be partial; run `/bug-hunter --loop <path>` for complete queued
coverage.
```

Do **not** say that `LOOP_MODE=false` implies the user passed `--no-loop`—it is
the normal default.

If `LOOP_MODE=true`, read `modes/loop.md` (or `modes/fix-loop.md` when fixing)
and use the supported loop driver. Initialize/consult the guarded experiment
state as defined there. Do not pretend a loop will continue without an active
driver.

## 4. Optional measurable context

Integrations driving `scripts/run-bug-hunter.cjs` may provide schema-valid:

- `.bug-hunter/benchmark-report.json`;
- `.bug-hunter/adaptive-plan.json` (`auto`, `fast`, `balanced`, `assurance`);
- `.bug-hunter/retrieval-plan.json`;
- exact-hash evidence-cache facts;
- `.bug-hunter/verification-plan.json` / `verification-report.json`.

These are bounded **evidence/context policies**, not new permissions. Explicit
caller source/chunk/token/confidence settings take precedence. An adaptive plan
cannot broaden repository scope or grant mutation authority.

Hypothesis-directed retrieval should load mandatory/direct evidence first and
admit optional symbols, dependencies, dependents, cross-references, and trust
boundaries only while hard budgets remain.

Evidence-cache hits are hints bound to exact source/protocol/role/options/
hypothesis identity. Re-check current assigned source before relying on them.

See `docs/world-class-protocol.md` for the measurable architecture.

## 5. Optional security context

### Threat model

When `THREAT_MODEL_MODE=true`, read:

`skills/threat-model-generation/SKILL.md`

Generate or reuse Bug Hunter-native `.bug-hunter/threat-model.md` and related
security configuration according to that skill. Existing current threat-model
context may be reused as read-only evidence.

### Dependency evidence

When `DEP_SCAN=true`, run:

```bash
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/dep-scan.cjs" \
  --target "<TARGET_PATH>" --output .bug-hunter/dep-findings.json
```

Supported parsing/reachability is currently for JavaScript/TypeScript projects
using npm, pnpm, Yarn, or Bun lockfiles. `scanner-unsupported` is unresolved,
not clean.

### Bundled security workflows

Route these flags through their bundled local skills:

- `--pr-security` -> `skills/commit-security-scan/SKILL.md`
- `--security-review` -> `skills/security-review/SKILL.md`
- `--threat-model` -> `skills/threat-model-generation/SKILL.md`
- `--validate-security` -> `skills/vulnerability-validation/SKILL.md`

Security workflow intent alone never grants Fixer authority.

## 6. Load roles progressively

Canonical role instructions live under `skills/`; compatibility files under
`prompts/` are generated copies and are not an independent source of truth.

Load only the role needed for the current phase:

| Phase | Canonical instructions |
|---|---|
| Recon | `skills/recon/SKILL.md` |
| Hunter | `skills/hunter/SKILL.md` |
| Skeptic | `skills/skeptic/SKILL.md` |
| Referee | `skills/referee/SKILL.md` |
| Fixer | `skills/fixer/SKILL.md` |
| Documentation | `skills/doc-lookup/SKILL.md` |

Calibration examples are **progressive**, not mandatory context for every
assignment. Follow each role skill's instructions: load Hunter/Skeptic examples
only for ambiguous/lower-confidence cases or when explicitly useful. Do not
spend context on examples for settled cases.

For delegated phases, include only the assigned bugs/files and necessary prior
evidence. Do not copy whole merged ledgers into every worker prompt.

## 7. Choose execution mode

Use `triage.strategy` as the size/partitioning strategy:

- `single-file` -> `modes/single-file.md`
- `small` -> `modes/small.md`
- `parallel` -> `modes/parallel.md`
- `extended` -> `modes/extended.md`
- `scaled` -> `modes/scaled.md`
- `large-codebase` -> `modes/large-codebase.md`

If the selected backend is local-sequential, use
`modes/local-sequential.md` as the execution implementation while retaining the
triage scope/order/budget.

Do not automatically turn a large-codebase request into loop mode. If the user
did not request `--loop`, execute an honest single pass and report partial
queued coverage. When `--loop` is active, combine the size mode with the loop
contract.

Extended/scaled/persisted execution should use `.bug-hunter/state.json`, exact
source hashes, bounded retries, and fresh per-attempt output. The composition
runner requires a real worker command that writes the requested canonical
artifact; there is no no-op worker.

## 8. Evidence and source-integrity invariants

These rules are non-negotiable across every mode:

- Assigned paths are canonicalized through real paths and remain inside the
  repository.
- A worker may report findings only for its exact assigned source files.
- Capture source hashes before dispatch and recheck them immediately before
  committing findings/fact cards/completion state.
- Source mutation, deletion, unreadability, or symlink escape fails the affected
  chunk closed.
- Resume retains the original source baseline; changed content cannot silently
  become a new baseline for an interrupted run.
- Missing/invalid canonical artifacts are failed phases, never clean evidence.
- Coverage is derived from per-file evidence; a parent chunk marked done cannot
  manufacture file completion.
- Duplicate observations preserve the strongest evidence and useful unioned
  cross-references/security metadata.
- Findings without completed adversarial review stay `unreviewed` or
  `manual-review` and cannot authorize fixing.

## 9. Hunter -> Skeptic -> Referee

### Hunter

Read assigned production source in risk/retrieval order. Findings require a
concrete runtime trigger and repository evidence. Security findings must satisfy
the canonical findings schema, including actionable STRIDE/CWE evidence when
required. Test files are context-only.

Canonical output: `.bug-hunter/hunter-findings.json`.

### Skeptic

Challenge each finding from current code and relevant cross-references. Verify
framework-dependent disprovals against documentation when possible. Generic
rate-limit suggestions may be cheap to dismiss, but reachable credential
stuffing, OTP/reset abuse, lockout bypass, measurable amplification, and
attacker-triggered expensive work receive normal analysis.

Canonical output: `.bug-hunter/skeptic.json`.

### Referee

Referee independently owns final `REAL_BUG`, `NOT_A_BUG`, or `MANUAL_REVIEW`
verdicts. Missing/failed Referee review leaves the finding unresolved and
non-writable.

Canonical output: `.bug-hunter/referee.json`.

## 10. Hybrid verification

When a verification plan is supplied/required, execute it through the bounded
hybrid verifier. Checks run as inert argv arrays with repository containment,
secret stripping/redaction, output/time budgets, and `shell:false` semantics.

A required check that fails, times out, or is unavailable makes verification
fail closed. **Required verification failure prevents Fixer authorization.** A
passing test/compiler/static check is evidence; it is not proof that unrelated
bugs do not exist.

Canonical output: `.bug-hunter/verification-report.json`.

## 11. Join and present the scan result

Always preserve canonical Hunter/Referee artifacts and build the joined
`.bug-hunter/scan-report.json`. Render `.bug-hunter/report.md` as a human view.
JSON is the automation source of truth.

Final results must distinguish:

- `confirmed` — Referee accepted the finding;
- `dismissed` — evidence disproved it;
- `manualReview` — a human/wider decision remains;
- `unreviewed` — adversarial review did not finish;
- failed/pending coverage;
- required-verification failure when applicable.

Do not claim “audit complete”, “full coverage”, or “clean” while the requested
scope still has unresolved review, failed coverage, or required-verification
failure.

If `LOOP_MODE=true`, continue according to the loop contract until every queued
source file reaches a terminal outcome or an explicit hard blocker/user stop
ends the run. If `LOOP_MODE=false`, report exactly what one pass covered and
recommend `--loop` when full queued coverage is desired.

## 12. Plan and fix only with authority

If there are confirmed bugs and `PLAN_ONLY_MODE=true` or `FIX_MODE=true`, build
canonical remediation strategy/plan artifacts. Classify findings before
creating executable Fixer work.

Only Referee-confirmed, confidence-eligible, `safe-autofix` entries in the
validated canary/rollout plan may enter immutable Fixer scope. Entries marked
`manual-review`, `larger-refactor`, `architectural-remediation`, conflicting,
or report-only remain non-writable regardless of severity.

Canonical remediation files include:

- `.bug-hunter/fix-strategy.json`
- `.bug-hunter/fix-plan.json`
- `.bug-hunter/fixer-scope.json`
- `.bug-hunter/fix-report.json`

For actual mutation, read `modes/fix-pipeline.md` and `skills/fixer/SKILL.md`.
Preserve Git/worktree/lock/canary/circuit-breaker/rollback safeguards. Requested
worktree isolation must not silently fall back to direct edits. Commit only
when `AUTO_COMMIT=true`, and only approved paths.

If `DRY_RUN_MODE=true`, stop before edits/lock/commits and report planned output
as a preview, not an applied fix.

## Canonical artifacts

Important schema-backed artifacts under `.bug-hunter/`:

| Artifact | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `triage.json` | deterministic risk/scope/budget input |
| `adaptive-plan.json` | bounded adaptive context/review policy |
| `recon.json` | architecture/trust-boundary context |
| `retrieval-plan.json` | hypothesis-ranked bounded evidence |
| `hunter-findings.json` | Hunter claims |
| `skeptic.json` | adversarial challenges |
| `referee.json` | final verdicts |
| `verification-report.json` | hybrid verification evidence |
| `scan-report.json` | joined final machine result |
| `coverage.json` | per-file coverage state |
| `fix-strategy.json` | remediation classifications |
| `fix-plan.json` | canary/rollout plan |
| `fixer-scope.json` | immutable mutation boundary |
| `fix-report.json` | remediation/verification/rollback result |
| `benchmark-report.json` | precision/recall/calibration/stability/cost/latency metrics |

## Quality and benchmarking

For source development, the full repository gate is:

```bash
pnpm quality:world-class
```

The bundled benchmark fixture validates the measurement/gating contract. It is
not independent proof of universal superiority. External claims require unseen
repositories, blinded labels, repeated runs, disclosed model/runtime versions,
and comparable baselines. See `docs/world-class-protocol.md`.

## Self-test

From a **source checkout**, the development fixture can be scanned in read-only
mode and scored with `evals/evaluate-fixture.cjs`. The npm runtime may exclude
development fixture answers. Use the benchmark gate for deterministic protocol
regression rather than copying a historical test-count claim into this skill.

## Failure policy

Fail closed for:

- invalid/missing required canonical artifacts;
- source-integrity or repository-containment failure;
- required verification failure;
- invalid delegated payload;
- Referee failure for affected findings;
- immutable Fixer-scope violation;
- unsafe Git/worktree preservation state.

Recoverable worker failures may retry within configured bounds using fresh
attempt outputs. Unrecoverable chunks remain failed/partial and visible.

Never convert unavailable evidence, unsupported scanners, failed review, or
failed safety checks into a clean result.
