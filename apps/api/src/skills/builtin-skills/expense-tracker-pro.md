# Expense Tracker Pro

Track your spending with natural conversation. No apps, no spreadsheets—just tell Clawd what you spent.

## What it does

Logs expenses from natural language ("spent $45 on groceries"), categorizes automatically, tracks against budgets, and provides spending summaries on demand. Data persists in your local Clawd memory.

## Usage

**Log an expense:**
```
"Spent $23.50 on lunch"
"$150 for electricity bill"
"Coffee $4.75"
```

**Check spending:**
```
"What did I spend this week?"
"Show my food expenses this month"
"Am I over budget on entertainment?"
```

**Set budgets:**
```
"Set grocery budget to $400/month"
"Budget $100 for entertainment"
```

**Get reports:**
```
"Monthly expense breakdown"
"Compare spending to last month"
"Export expenses to CSV"
```
